# Development log

Updated: 2026-09-19. This file records actual implementation progress; proposed
features live in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Update this log at task transitions and
before each milestone commit. Never mark unverified functionality complete.

## Current work

Phase 2: connect the tested engine to a local web server and selectable globe,
with inspection, time controls, saved state, and direct creator interventions.

## Completed

- Reviewed the reference globe source and documented the product decisions.
- Wrote the implementation plan and proposed engine–world interface.
- Added texture-library and colored-at-birth rendering requirements.
- Initialized the local Git repository on `main`.

## Milestones and tasks

| Phase | Status | Tasks / exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Planning and tracking | Complete | Product plan, interface proposal, this living log. |
| 1. Engine foundation | Complete | npm/TypeScript setup; stable spherical topology; seeded worlds; pure ticks; validated declarative interventions; persistence; deterministic/conservation tests; CLI. |
| 2. First playable globe | In progress | Local server; colored globe; picking; inspector; pause/step/play; rain/elevation/channel controls; save/reload; appearance catalog/UV foundation. |
| 3. Prompt workflow | Pending | Discuss/propose/apply; direct API adapter; `.env` config; explicit local Cursor/Claude Code exchange; no autonomous calls. |
| 4. World extensibility | Pending | Definition migrations; full rule expression language; sandbox feasibility and plugin execution; artwork packs; branches/import/export. |
| 5. Broader simulation | Pending | Rich hydrology/erosion; trade/food/population; knowledge, technology, conflict, migration; long-run tuning. |
| 6. Polish and scale | Pending | Accessibility, browser automation, performance at reference resolution, packaging and integration hardening. |

## Publishing

- Requested target: new public repository, proposed `CyberSecDef/logos_engine`.
- GitHub CLI authentication currently fails: saved token is invalid. User asked
  to authenticate locally; development and local milestone commits can continue.
- Push each completed major milestone once authentication is available. Never
  include `.env`, credentials, generated saves, or local agent transcripts.

## Decisions and remaining questions

- Use installed Node.js 22 initially; retain a provider-neutral adapter contract.
  Bun and the sandbox runtime remain subjects of compatibility testing.
- No blocking product questions. Provider credentials, application transports,
  and plugin runtime capabilities must be verified before those integrations.

## Activity

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 1 started

- Inspected the workspace and tooling: Node 22.22.1, npm 9.2.0, GitHub CLI.
- Initialized Git; confirmed GitHub authentication is blocked independently of
  the filesystem sandbox. No public repository has been created yet.
- Next: establish a testable deterministic engine before wiring rendering.

## Validation

Phase 1 checks passed: `npm test` and direct execution of the five engine tests.
CLI create → 10 daily steps → reload/inspect preserved the recorded state hash.
Tests cover connected/reciprocal topology and area, deterministic 100-tick replay,
water accounting, atomic/stale/duplicate proposals, communication-independent
runoff with sediment conservation, and checksummed storage/path validation.

### 2026-09-19 — Engine foundation implemented, verification in progress

- Added npm workspaces, strict TypeScript, pinned dependencies, and Node test runner.
- Adapted MIT Goldberg topology with stable adjacency and spherical tile areas.
- Added seeded fictional geography and explicit runtime-validated state schemas.
- Implemented pure daily ticks: seasonal temperature, rain, evaporation,
  simultaneous downhill runoff, sediment transport, and vegetation response.
- Added atomic rain/elevation/communication transactions, revision checks,
  duplicate rejection, and side-effect-free bounded previews.
- Added checksummed atomic saves and a create/step/inspect CLI.
- Running topology, replay, water accounting, transaction, runoff, and persistence
  tests before the first implementation commit.
- Scope note: ocean drainage is an explicit sink; soil erosion, sediment
  generation, backwater flow, trade, and population dynamics are not implemented.

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 1 complete

- Five engine tests passed, plus CLI create/step/reload smoke checks.
- Preparing the foundation milestone commit; GitHub push still awaits login.
- Started Phase 2 server and interactive globe implementation.
